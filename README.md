# TextGenerator
### Text generating AI agent from the University of Otago's COSC343 paper. 

Two files to interact with are "SRNTrain.py" and "loadingModel.py".
The former reads in a body of text which the model is trained on, and the later calls upon that model to predict a new body of text based off a prompt string.

This model was trained on Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, sourced from: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61/61.txt
